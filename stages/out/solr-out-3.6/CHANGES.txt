changed .se to .com in scm statement

Removed idol branch. Can be found under stages/idol-out instead

refs #2970
Added field mapping configuration to SolrOutPutStage
As with this commit you are required to provide a field mapping. Maybe this should be changed? We should probably add the abillity to choose to index all fields and specify if you want to index dynamic fields. 
A test is written but ignored since the method that uses the field mapping is set to private. Don't know how to handl unit testing of private methods, maybe is an indication that the SolrOutPutStage needs refactoring.
