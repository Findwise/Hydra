0.0.1

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Updated to not use snapshot of basic stages

Added descriptions to parameters and stage

Changed returnHTML parameter to be a boolean instead of a string

A JsoupSelectorStage that is set to return HTML will now return the HTML of the selected element and children, and not just the children.

Added parameter for returning the raw HTML content of the selected tag (default false).
Operates on a stage level, so all configs for the same instance are affected.

Added test for pseudo-selectors

Properly handle listfields, appending the selected content of each list item to the output field

Tests for IBM Connections Memberlist extraction added

Added a test that checks that if there is now field to perform the jsoup selector on the output field will not be created (it will be null)

Added support for fields having list values

Fixed English in configuration comment
Added test for extracting XMLdata

Added test for when the field that is supposed to containt the HTML does not exist.

Added test for empty HTML field

Fixed nullpointer bug when content field does not exist

Added test for parsing text from broken HTML. Also fixed a bug when singlevalue was set to true and the selector didn't return any value.

Added test for extracting all text (selector using *)

Updated the JsoupSelector stage to use the new configuration annotations (also updated test)
