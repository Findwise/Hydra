                    1958 New York Convention<sup>1</sup> provides for the reciprocal enforcement 
                    of arbitration awards. A central feature of the Convention 
                    is that the awards be international in nature. One of the 
                    concerns of lawyers involved in trade between Hong Kong and 
                    the Mainland has been directed to the enforceability of Hong 
                    Kong arbitration awards in China after the hand-over (1st 
                    July 1997). Until now there has been a void.</font>

                    The convention continued to apply to Hong Kong after the hand-over. 
                    The enforcement arrangements with other jurisdictions remains 
                    unchanged except for that with Mainland China since the convention, 
                    being an international agreement, no longer applied to the 
                    enforcement of awards between the Mainland and Hong Kong. 
                    A new arrangement has been reached, made in accordance with 
                    the spirit of the New York Convention, which will allow awards 
                    made by over 100 Mainland Chinese arbitral authorities to 
                    be enforced in the Hong Kong SAR when the Arbitration (Amendment) 
                    Bill is introduced into the Legislative Council (and passed). 
                    The Chinese Courts in the Mainland also agree to enforce the 
                    awards made in Hong Kong pursuant to the Arbitration Ordnance 
                    of Hong Kong SAR. The new arrangement will also apply to arbitral 
                    awards made by the Mainland or Hong Kong SAR published after 
                    1st July 1997.</font></td>

                to enforce the award if contrary to the public policy of each
