Hydra Processing Framework

Getting started
	1. Install MongoDB, and start it
	2. Check out and build hydra-core
	3. Start the built jar with 
		java -jar hydra-core-jar-with-dependencies.jar
	   or just run the Main class from your IDE
	
	You now have a running pipeline system. Try adding some documents using the API classes or the input-stages and play around with it.

For a basic pipeline you will need the following jars:
	hydra-core-jar-with-dependencies - the framework itself
	basic-stages-jar-with-dependencies - a library of reusable stages
	solr-out-jar-with-dependencies - a library containing the SolrOutputStage which sends documents to Solr
								
Starting an AbstractStage-derived stage

	Let's say we want to change the *field* source in all documents that have been touched by the stage extractPDFMetadata to *pdf*. It should modify documents in the database intranet. Since our stage makes static changes to fields, we can use the stage SetStaticFieldStage (included in basic-stages) instead of building our own. Let's call our stage fixWrongSourceType. Since all configuration is done using Json, you'll need a Json representation of your configuration for the stage. It could look like this:
	
	{
		stageClass: "com.findwise.hydra.stage.SetStaticFieldStage",
		queryOptions: ["touched(extractTitles,true)"],
		fieldNames: ["source"],
		fieldValues: ["web"]
	}
	
	The easiest way to do this without coding is to use the CmdlineInserter-class found in the examples library:
	
	1. Add the library with the stage you want to add, in this case the basic-stages jar:
		Program arguments: add library *pipeline* basic-stages-jar-with-dependencies.jar
		You should see the following output:
		> Attempting to work with pipeline 'pipeline'
		> Added stage library with id: 4fa39d8dda06916a91fb9665
	2. Now, add your stage, by referencing the id to your library of stages, again using CmdlineInserter:
		Program arguments: add stage *pipeline* 4fa39d8dda06916a91fb9665 {stageClass: "com.findwise.hydra.stage.SetStaticFieldStage", queryOptions:["touched(extractTitles,true)"], fieldNames: ["source"],fieldValues: ["web"]}
		
		Alternatively, you can keep the Json in a separate file called <stagename>.properties, which will be read if you fail to provide any json on the command line.
